# map

Animates a bus marker along a route using Mapbox GL JS.The code creates a Mapbox GL map and adds a marker to it then uses a recursive setTimeout() function to move the marker to the next stops the animation when the marker reaches the last bus stop in the array.bus stop in the array every 1000ms.This code can be used to create simple animations of buses, cars, or other objects moving along a route.

# Steps to Run the Project
Create an HTML file. Create a new file with the .html extension, and add the following code to it.Save the JavaScript code. Create a new file with the .js extension, and paste the given code into it. Save the file as bus_animation.js.Open the HTML file in a web browser. Open the HTML file in your web browser of choice.See the bus animation! You should see a map with a bus marker at the first bus stop in the array. The marker will then be animated to the next bus stop every 1000ms.

# Future Improvements
Instead of using a pre-defined array of bus stops, the bus could follow a real-time route, such as the route of a real bus. This could be done by using a real-time bus tracking API to get the bus's current location and destination.
